# Bee nectar-gathering behaviour-based autonomous and intelligent control of drone swarms
A drone swarm is composed of a large number of lightweight and small drones that generally accomplish complex tasks by simulating the behaviour of biological clusters. Individual technologies of drone swarms have been in application testing, but autonomous and intelligent control is still a challenge. Here, we create an autonomous and intelligent control scheme of a drone swarm imitating bee nectar-gathering behaviour. In this scheme, the drone swarm is divided into scouter drones, follower drones and executor drones, and these kinds of drones accomplish the goal task through autonomous decision-making and intelligent role transformation. We organized 1000 drones into a drone swarm, and the drone swarm successfully accomplished 10 goal tasks at a constant speed of 20 m/s within the 200-metre radius simulation area full of obstacles. We believe that this scheme provides a simple and feasible method for developing autonomous and intelligent systems for drone swarms.
